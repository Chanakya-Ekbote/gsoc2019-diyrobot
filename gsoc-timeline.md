## :calendar: Timeline


The implementation details follow, organized by [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

## Phase 1 (May 27 - Jun 28)


The proper electronic parts selected for that project and  designed,printed and tested the 3D parts of the robot in a modular way with a tool-less philosophy. 

- Selection of electronic parts
- 3D designs :triangular_ruler:
- Parts printing stage
- Functionality tests of the parts
- Robot Assembly :wrench:

## Phase 2 (Jun 29 - Jul 26)


New libraries created for the communication between hardware-software.  A object oriented way for programming selected and the integration with Jupyter completed. 

- Control library
- Vision library
- OpenCV integration
- Special control and functionality library (e.x. PID Controller)
- Jupyter Notebook integration
- Wireless access, control and programming of the program achieved 

## Phase 3 (Jul 27 - Aug 26)


All the needed preparations completed  for easy deployment of software and material for the courses, user manuals and instructions created.

- Modifications of Rasbian image
- Courses on Jupyter Notebook (e.x. Line Follower robot)
- PDFs with extensive instructions for the assembly and usage of the robot
- Final debugging
- Wiki page created
